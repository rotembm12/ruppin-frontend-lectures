## CSS `box-sizing` Property Cheat Sheet: Focus on `border-box`

### Overview

The CSS `box-sizing` property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

### `content-box` vs. `border-box`

- **`content-box`** (the default): The width and height properties (and min/max properties) include only the content. Border, padding, or margin are not included.
- **`border-box`**: The width and height properties include content, padding, and border, but not the margin.

### Why Use `border-box`?

- **Simplifies layouts**: The element's total width does not change regardless of border size or padding, making layout design more straightforward.
- **Predictable sizing**: Elements with `border-box` are easier to size and position, as their outer dimensions do not increase with padding or borders.
- **Consistent cross-browser behavior**: Helps in creating layouts that look the same across different browsers.

### Syntax

```css
box-sizing: border-box;
```

### Global Setting

A common practice is to apply `border-box` to all elements on a page to make the box model more manageable:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Example Usage

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

In this example, the `.container`'s total width will be 100% of its parent, including any specified padding and border. Without `border-box`, the actual width would be 100% plus twice the padding plus twice the border width, likely causing layout issues.

### Benefits of `border-box`

- More intuitive resizing: Adding padding or borders doesn't change the overall dimensions of your boxes.
- Easier to calculate sizes: You don't need to subtract padding or borders from the element's width or height to maintain the layout.
- Consistency across elements: Makes it easier to align elements side by side without unexpected shifts due to border or padding differences.

### Compatibility

`box-sizing: border-box;` is widely supported in all modern web browsers, making it a reliable tool for web design.

### Considerations

- Remember that `margin` is not included in `border-box`. Margins still add outside the box.
- When transitioning from `content-box` to `border-box`, you may need to adjust element sizes to achieve the same layout due to the changed box model calculation.
